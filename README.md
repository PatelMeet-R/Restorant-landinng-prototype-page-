 Restorant-landinng-prototype-page </br>
 This project showcases a traditional restaurant landing page designed using HTML and CSS. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of HTML structure and layout design while expanding my knowledge of CSS properties, including advanced styling techniques. The project allowed me to experiment with new CSS features like card carousel, visually appealing, and user-friendly web interface.

 This website is not responsive yet I will improve my skill regarding responsive in next project (repo)
